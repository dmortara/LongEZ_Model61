# Composite basics using Adhesive Technologies

I am in New Zealand (South Pacific) and getting the materials around here is a bit of a challenge.

Thanks to Cameron Garner I located a suitable local epoxy resin replacement. __ADR246TG from Adhesive technologies NZ Ltd__.

>NOTE: __THIS IS NOT A PLAN'S APPROVED EPOXY__

__ADR246TG__ requires cures of 24h @ 20°C  followed by a post cure of 12h @ 60°C  to achieve a Heat Distortion Temperature (HDT) of 90°C. It's density is 1.14 g/ml

##  Chapter 3 - Practice Layup
Using ADR246TG and ADH28 (Adhesive Technologies NZ Ltd) I made the first layup of 6 BID to weight and examine the quality of my work/resin. The ratio of resin hardener is 4 to 1 (weight)
The workshop temperature was 20° C (68° F)

The 6 BID 12.5x18" plies weighted 299 ± 2 gr. I made two batches of composite of 150 ± 2 g each and ended with a bit of excess at the end. In principle the fiberglass/resin ratio used looked a bit too much (too wet?) Ideally the ratio in a finished layup should be 2:1 (fiberglass to resin weight ratio).


The trimmed 10x16" composite rectangle ended in 338 g (11.9 oz) which is 8.3 % heavier than the ideal weight of 312 g (11 oz) but still in the expected range of [298, 354] g ([10.5, 12.5] oz)

The finished width of the 6 BID plies test rectangle is 2.12±0.02 mm or 0.0835±0.0007 in . This corresponds to 0.353 mm per ply or 0.0139±0.001 in.
The expected width of a single BID ply is 0.013 in per ply or 0.078 in for 6 plies. This seems to be another indication that the layup was a bit too wet


I did a second 6 BID layup trying to get it a bit more light this time (Building up the squeegee muscles). The difference with my first layup is that I spent a bit more time squeegeeing this time and a bit less stabbing it with the brush. ADR wets the cloth really well . the pressure on the squeegee was still very low but I did quite a bit more passes.


This trimmed 10x16" composite rectangle for the second test weighted 317±1 g (11.18 oz) which is 1.02 % heavier than the ideal weight of 312 g (11 oz) but still in the expected range of [298, 354] g ([10.5, 12.5] oz)

The finished width of the second 6 BID test rectangle is 1.86±0.02 mm or 0.0732±0.0007 in . This is 0.31 mm per ply or 0.0122±0.001 in. The expected width of a BID ply is 0.013 in per ply or 0.078 in for 6 plies
